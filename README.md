go get -u github.com/tomill/maji
```

## Description

This command was written as a go version of tokuhirom's perl5 [App-watcher](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-watcher/script/watcher). Unlike [gomon](https://github.com/c9s/gomon), this uses simple polling (by [radovskyb/watcher](https://github.com/radovskyb/watcher)) instead of inotify. That is it works with NFS file system.
